# This should contain the name(s) and email(s) of the services

A:john <john@example.com>

# The first field is the name you want the services server to be.  It
# should match the C/N lines of the hub server.  The second field is
# the text info for the services (it corresponds to the third field
# in a server's M line)

N:irc-services.example.com:Hybrid services

# This line should contain three fields. In order, the password for
# the connection, the hostname (or IP address) of the hub server to
# connect to, and the port to connect at. If no port is specified,
# DefaultHubPort, specified in settings.conf, is used.  You may put
# as many S: lines as you wish. If services cannot connect to the
# first server, or gets disconnected, it will move onto the next one
# and so on.
# (The password must match the C/N lines of the hub server).

S:acceptpassw0rd:127.0.0.1

# V: lines specify a virtual hostname to bind to when connecting to
# a remote site. IP Addresses can be used as well. If multiple V:
# lines are given, only the first is used

#V:my.virtual.host.com
#V:12.34.56.78

# O: lines specify users who will have access to Hybserv.  The first
# field should contain the user's username@host.  The second should
# be a password that the user will be required to register with in 
# order to use services.  The third field is the nickname of the user
# (ie: the nickname that will appear in the partyline)  Finally, the
# fourth field is a list of flags the user will have, entitling them
# to different privileges.  All four fields must be given, or Hybserv
# will not consider the line valid. Read the file doc/README-FLAGS
# for full descriptions on each type of flag available.
# ** NOTE: All passwords should be encrypted if CRYPT_OPER_PASSWORDS
#          is defined in config.h (which is the default) - use
#          mkpasswd to generate the password

O:root@127.0.1.1:operpassw0rdh@sh:root:segj

# C: lines specify channels that OperServ will monitor.  The first
# field is the name of the channel. 

C:#HybNet
C:#services

# I: lines specify restricted hostmasks.  The fields, in order:
# the hostmask, the number of connections allowed from the hostmask,
# whether to (1) gline the entire host instead of user@host when
# advanced flood is detected or not (0).
# The last field has no effect if ADVFLOOD_GLINE was not
# enabled at compiletime, hence its specification is optional.

# Allows only 3 connections from cloneguy@*.clones.org, gline just
# the offending user if they start advanced floods, not the entire host
#I:cloneguy@*.clones.org:3:0
# Allows a total of 6 users from the .blah.com domain, gline the 
# entire host if they're flooding, not just the offending user
#I:*.blah.com:6:1

# B: lines are to specify TCM bots to link to.  The fields are, in 
# order, the hostname of the box the TCM is running on, the nickname
# of the TCM, the password to use for linking to the TCM, and the
# port the TCM is listening on.  If you don't specify a port, the
# default of 6800 is used.  Make sure that the TCM bots you list here
# have an N: and C: line in their userlist.cf, matching the password,
# nick (OperServ), and hostname that Hybserv is running on.

#B:irc.tcm.com:tcmMON:FakePass:6800
#B:irc.tcm2.org:lalaMON:Blah:

# L: lines give remote TCM bots access to link to Hybserv.  The fields
# are the hostmask of the remote TCM's box, the nickname of the TCM,
# and the password for connecting.  Please see the file TCM-LINKING
# if you have no clue what a TCM is, or are not sure how to get a
# TCM to link to Hybserv.

#L:*.tcm.org:tcmMON:FakePass

# P: lines specify ports to listen on for tcm or user connections
# The fields are the hostmask to accept (optional), the port
# number to listen on, and the type of connection to allow
# (ie: tcm or users)  The hostmask field is only used if the
# connection is for users, since the tcm hostmask is given in
# the first field of the L: line

# Listens for tcm bot connections on port 6900
#P::6900:tcm
